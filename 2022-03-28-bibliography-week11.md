<p>&ldquo;Against Cleaning&rdquo;(<em>Against Cleaning</em>) talks about a problem that is especially present in the humanities fields when we combine digital technologies to humanities studies&mdash;" data cleaning is then maligned because it is&nbsp;Understood as a step that inscribes a normative order by wiping away what is different. The term &ldquo;cleaning&rdquo; implies that a data set is &ldquo;messy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Messy&rdquo; suggests an underlying order. It supposes things already have a&nbsp;rightful place, but they&rsquo;re not in it&mdash;like socks on the bedroom floor rather than in the wardrobe or the laundry hamper&rdquo;. I love the way how Katie Rawson and Trevor Mu&ntilde;oz bring in Anna Tsing&rsquo;s idea of scalability into the discussion, and argues that &ldquo;&ldquo;cleaning up&rdquo; or &ldquo;correcting&rdquo; values was a misleading&mdash;and even unproductive&mdash;way to think about how to make the data more useful for our own questions and for other scholars studying food&rdquo;. In menus, there are so many distinctive and diversified features that are impossible to just &ldquo;scale up&rdquo;. In the digital humanities projects that I have done before, data cleaning process takes up most of the space and time (10 months of cleaning and 2 weeks of analyzing). And of course, the cleaning process is usually uncredited in the final paper and there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a systematic way of describing it in our field yet. This phenomenon makes me question, what is left out in the cleaning process of data and is it possible to have a special study just on the left out data?</p>
<p>While reading &ldquo;Markup Bodies:&nbsp;Black [Life] Studies and Slavery [Death] Studies at the Digital Crossroads&rdquo; (Johnson), I am surprised by the argument &ldquo;It argues that, while digitizing the study of slavery threatens to replicate the death work of the slave ship register, black digital practice offers a way of thinking through black life by invoking what the #transformDH collective has described as the digital humanities&rsquo; potential for &ldquo;social justice, accessibility, and inclusion.&rdquo; Please note that what I am surprised was not the second half but the first half. What does it mean when it says &ldquo;digitizing threatens to replicate the deathwork&rdquo;? as I was reading the article, it provides an answer, &ldquo;The archive of Atlantic slavery &mdash; images, numbers, and texts created by slave owners, traders, investors, abolitionists, and the enslaved themselves &mdash; haunts efforts to render black people as human&rdquo;. The scaling up of data erases the individuality of black slaves, and rendered them &ldquo;faceless, anonymous, disembodied&rdquo;. To solve this question, we see efforts to use digitization not only as scalable data, but also recording experiences, &ldquo;eBlack, the virtualization of the Black experience, is the basis for the next stage of our academic discipline.&rdquo; I am wondering if there are other traumatic experiences and histories that may be intrinsically resistance or inappropriate to scale up (like the holocaust experiences) and how we should deal with the statistical parts of these analyses? How can we combine the rather wholistic statistical analysis with the more vivid life experiences in digitalization?</p>
<p>If we regard the more scaling up statistical projects in Black Digital Humanities as disregarding individual faces, features and efforts, it is not hard to see that similar issues are also happening in today&rsquo;s AI development. &ldquo;the kind of invisible, hidden labor, outsourced or crowdsourced, hidden behind interfaces and camouflaged within algorithmic processes is now commonplace, particularly in the process of tagging and labeling thousands of hours of digital archives for the sake of feeding the neural networks&rdquo; (Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler). Indeed, we rarely acknowledged the labor intensive data processing works in digitization, and this greatly influenced the progress of digital humanities &ndash; who would like to do the job in the project that is extremely tedious, time consuming and rendered insignificant? Then how to acknowledge the human labor hidden behind AI development? Are we focusing on the productions of AI too much that we tend to ignore the human efforts behind them? Are we, to some extent, too optimistic about AI development?</p>
