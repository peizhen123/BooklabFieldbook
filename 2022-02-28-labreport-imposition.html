<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the ashes a fire shall be woken,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A light from the shadows shall spring;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renewed shall be blade that was broken,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crownless again shall be king.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This excerpt of a poem came from J. R. R. Tolkien&rsquo;s famous novel, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lord of the Rings</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This poem (or ballad, if you like) comes from Bilbo Baggins, and it is about a prophecy of Aragorn, the future king of Gondor.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I chose this excerpt because, first, Tolkien is one of my favorite writers, and this is one of his most famous poems. In fact, the last two lines of the poem are pretty well-spreaded, as it can be used in any contexts with a person regaining faith or power. Second, there is a transformation of the media regarding my relation to this poem. I first encountered this poem not in print, but through sound &ndash; this excerpt is spoken in the movie adaptation of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lord of the Rings</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Peter Jackson. While watching this movie, I was intrigued by this poem, as Arwen, Aragorn&rsquo;s future wife, narrated the poem with images of fire, the great elven sword and the old crown of Gondor. Therefore, I would regard my first encounter with this poem as both of sound and of images (there is Arwen&rsquo;s voice reading this poem aloud, and there is also background music accompanying the poem). These medias together took me into this fantastic world, full of magical creatures, long lost bloodlines and pre-determined fate. If we only read this excerpt by itself, this poem does not look stunning (Tolkien is not a professional poet). But to read it with the context of Middle Earth, my perception of this poem is more immersive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That being said, I have a deeper engagement with this poem while composing this poem through Letterpress, and this, I believe, speaks to the &ldquo;historical context&rdquo; of this poem. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lord of the Rings</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a clear sense of nostalgia towards the past &ndash; a world of elves, dwarves and men, and a world of swords, knights and fire. However, my first encounter with this poem is so much relying on modern technology (the film media), that the historical burden of the poem is lost. Like the trend that Octave Uzanne&rsquo;s &ldquo;The End of Books&rdquo; talks about, &ldquo;Libraries will be transformed into phonographotecks, or rather, phonostereoteks&rdquo;; and authors will become &ldquo;tellers&rdquo; with recordings. The poem, spoken by an actor in a film, transforms from a narrator (Bilbo Baggins) to a teller (of a film).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But working out this poem again in our Letterpress experiment brings the burden back to me &ndash; the burden of limitation. While composing this poem on the composing stick, I have to consider the amount of space I have for the poem (I had to cut each line into two to fit the composing stick, or they might be too long). Also, the fear of using the wrong letter also gives a special burden, as it is hard to differentiate &ldquo;b&rdquo; and &ldquo;d&rdquo; while you are composing in a mirroring image. I took a picture of my composing stick after I finished the process and found that I made several mistakes, so I had to redo that whole line again and change the letters that I did wrong. The pressure that I experienced through working in the Letterpress experiment offers an immersive experience different from a 3d experience from a film because, though it doesn&rsquo;t offer sound, image and words simultaneously, it offers a sense of engagement. From the poem to its movie adaptation, the authors become tellers, but through composing this through letterpress, we change from &ldquo;listeners&rdquo; to &ldquo;writers&rdquo;, or someone who spreads the words like Homer did.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the session, I looked at the poem I composed in the Galley with my fingers colored by ink and my neck stiff. It is not integrated (only an excerpt), and also it is broken (I cut the lines). But for me, this is still an immersive and engaging experience different from the forced ones created by a film. Knowing that these words are going to be printed out and (in a historical printing shop) disseminated gives me a sense of responsibility that I am a part of the creation of an inheritance of a historical legacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
