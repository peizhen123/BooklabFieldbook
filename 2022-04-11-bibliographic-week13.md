<p>It is fascinating that after several weeks of technological exploration, this week, we are back to the general reflection about books, libraries, indexing, which are in broader terms. As it turns out, these readings offer new insights for me after what we have gone through in this semester. Namely, as a literary scholar, I started to treat techniques like indexing as more independent subjects.</p>
<p>The Atlantic Article, As We May Think, starts with a quote, &ldquo;Consider a future device &hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.&rdquo; This immediately reminds me of the several cyberpunk novels I have been reading, in which human minds and all other kinds of information are all uploaded onto the &ldquo;Net&rdquo;, and memories become digitized. Of course, we are not that far yet, but I think the cloud systems today are already doing a part of the &ldquo;storing&rdquo; job that this article mentions. Nevertheless, storing is only a first step. Throughout the article, there are actually quite a few steps we also need to think about, such as selection, consultation, extension, etc. One part that I found fascinating is the indexing part. &nbsp;Data is stored either alphabetically or chronologically and can be found in subclasses, but &ldquo;The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain&rdquo;. I did realize that when I am using Zotero to write literature reviews, the &ldquo;find&rdquo; function is not especially helpful because, instead of remembering names and titles, I only have a faint idea of how the article that I am thinking about is connected with the article that I am reading. But the &ldquo;find&rdquo; tool cannot assist me on that. Then the question comes, is there a way to ask machines to imitate the association way of thoughts like humans do? And, if it turns out there is a way to do it, how does it cope with the problem that every individual&rsquo;s &ldquo;connection&rdquo; is diverse and highly individualized?</p>
<p>The chapter &ldquo;Indexed&rdquo; also speaks to this problem of indexing. Instead of viewing indexing as a rigid process, this chapter regards the process as an &ldquo;extensible&rdquo; and &ldquo;connection&rdquo; one, and with that the books become &ldquo;unfinished, connecting it to places, persons, and things beyond its pages&rdquo;. As a literary scholar, it didn&rsquo;t occur to me that we can view indexing as a process more than its functional purpose. But through reading this chapter, I realized that indexing can be a personal exploration. &ldquo;&ldquo;[s]ome books are Indexical of men and women. Such are the reports of the transactions of Societies. These books are invaluable as showing you the way to good [unprinted] matter and to men and women, many of them enthusiasts, and accessible to students&rdquo; (392). Tracing through the indexing of an individual is like tracing through his or her way of thoughts. While it is fascinating to trace the way of thoughts of historical figures, I am also wondering how it is possible to contextualize the process. if we are to view indexing as an &ldquo;association&rdquo;, we cannot ignore its association with the figure&rsquo;s personal backgrounds and living time and space. That is to say, if we need to digitize this indexing process and make it publicly available to contemporary readers, how should we present it alongside with its historical contexts, knowing that readers might not have time to extensively study all the books the person has read? Benjamin Lee&rsquo;s article on the Newspaper Navigating Dataset offers an example on how Machine Learning can be used in possibly recontextualizing historical documents. But the personal indexing here can be more complicated as it is intrinsically an individualized process.</p>
