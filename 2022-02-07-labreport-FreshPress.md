<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the introduction of &ldquo;The Intimacy of Paper in Early and Nineteenth-Century American Literature&rdquo;, Senchyne argues, "in this introduction, I have proposed that these blank sheets should be experienced and also read, even though there is no alphabetic writing inscribed on them." (33). The paper making activity in the Fresh Paper lab offers this chance to &ldquo;read&rdquo; through these blank sheets. What took my attention was the &ldquo;imperfect&rdquo; features of the papers we made and what &ldquo;identities&rdquo; they can shed on the maker. I am very used to the pure white, thin, perfect size, mass produced paper that we always see in our printing room in the English department, or from the books that we are reading. But producing papers in the Fresh Paper lab is different &ndash; we not only see, but also experience the excitement and frustration of producing imperfect paper molds when we were dragging fibers out of water in the first step, or putting them on the compressor machine in the second. The moment of holding the wooden mold in my hand and waiting the fiber to dry and solidate was a breathtaking one &ndash;&nbsp; I remember recalling all the procedures I had done just before seeing fibers form (pulling fiber materials out of water, holding the mold horizontally in my hand, putting the frame on it, etc.) and reflect in which step I might have done wrong. Later, when we were "tearing" down compressed products to dry, I was still identifying which piece of paper was my product (I remember saying to Brian that &ldquo;that piece is definitely mine because its shape is not symmetric as other ones&rdquo;). Senchyne argues, &ldquo;The readings in The Intimacy of Paper explore how the rag content of paper mediates intimacy by transmitting material history and narrative, and by making bodies present to one another&rdquo; (14). Then, unlike the mass produced papers we are using today, how can we deduce the identities of the rag papers in historical times? I am talking about perceivable difference beyond detective-like identification process of paper making &ndash; how would we perceive the content of a book differently if we read between, say, reading a book printed in modern mass produced paper and in hand printed paper done on my own, knowing that the identity of the book contents and the papers are both creating a connection with me as a reader?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The environmental approach of the Fresh Press is also fascinating to analyze. While I was reading the article, I perceived the &ldquo;environmental friendly&rdquo; part of the Fresh Press concerns only the materials producing the paper (that is, the fiber). However, in our experiment, we see how the process of the whole production indicates this environmental concern. The desk that is used to capture fiber from water has its delicate design to reuse water. In fact, the process of seeing water flows from the basin to the basket through the sink and then reused is an educating moment for participants of this experiment. Through engaging with this paper making experiment, I think what Fresh Press can inspire humanities scholars is through active engagements from a wider public. The humanities academia today has a sense of coterie culture &ndash; in a sense, particular barriers are created through theoretical jargons and excessive external quotes to block non-academic amateurs from engaging in literary analysis. But what the Fresh Press is doing is just the opposite &ndash; it does not require participants to have excessive knowledge about historical paper making, and even younger children can enjoy the experiments and learn some mindsets of environmental friendly concerns (like seeing water flow on the desk). Then are there ways for humanities to be more open to the public not just in accessibility but also in engagements? AI poem competitions, mapping games for historical figures and similar projects in DH might have more inspirations towards the engagement perspective.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding the paper tablet, I can share some ideas of using one as a personal experience. The paper tablet is trying to imitate the paper reading experience &ndash; through its black and white paperlike screen (which costs more than a common digital screen); page turning animations, attached pens that resemble a real pen in its form, weight and touch; long-lasting batteries, etc. There is definitely a sense of nostalgia embedded in these designs (especially for a generation like us who grew up as students using pen and paper), but apart from that, I see how technologies are trying to be &ldquo;focused&rdquo; instead of being more versatile. An ideal paper tablet only has reading and notetaking functions, and all other social media and entertaining applications should be kept away from this tablet. In fact, the low refresh rate design of the paper tablet might be intentional to keep you away from modern time apps. (for a book, it takes time to turn from one page to the next) It is a silent resistance to the information boom happening today. While I am using the paper tablet to read, I feel more concentrated because of the none-distractible environment it created and being incapable of &ldquo;scrolling&rdquo;. This makes reading longer works in a more focused way available, like a book does. </span></p>
