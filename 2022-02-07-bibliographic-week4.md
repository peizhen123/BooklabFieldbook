It centers around the idea of intimacy and explains &ldquo;how the rag content of paper mediates intimacy by transmitting material history and narrative, and by making bodies present to one another&rdquo; (13). It can be regarded as an intersection of the study of ideas presented in the texts and the study of materials these texts are based on. I am particularly interested in how the author brings the idea of philology into hand. &quot;&rdquo;The work of the scholar is to find the meaning &ldquo;behind&rdquo; something, to look &ldquo;through&rdquo; its surface to reveal the spirit that lies within the body (24-25). If we regard philology as the study of the meaning of the texts, then how would the material that the texts are presented influence our understanding? As Kittler argues, &ldquo;human thought does not happen outside the affordances of available inscription systems&rdquo; (25), the production of meaning might not exceed its material form, but how would we differentiate production of meaning to understanding/experiencing of meaning? Relating this to the lab experience we had in the rare books library the week before, how did we experience those Books and how was this experience different from the digitized version of these books that we can read online? Can we discover more evidence in the papers that hold the texts? Is it still the case in today&rsquo;s standardized printing? Frankly speaking, my understanding of philology before didn&apos;t incorporate that much of the materiality of the text. But it is this introduction and conclusion that led me to think about how the material of rock paper itself can influence the spread of ideas.&nbsp;</span></p>

But in this context, intimacy means immersion more. &ldquo;We would be better people if we disappeared into books instead&rdquo; (86). Through the use of table of contents and index, the books are actually becoming more readable and intractable. &ldquo;The value placed on reading during the Renaissance was not simply in absorbing a text, but in actively engaging, consuming, and reframing it&rdquo; (88). At the same time, people are starting to annotate books, and students are annotating textbooks to take notes. It is fascinating to think about how annotation makes more intimacy between the reader and the book. In our experiment last week, we were not allowed to take notes on the books in the rare books library. I am wondering to what extent annotations will make a book more individualized, and how would the value of the books be impacted because of the annotations. For second-handed books, the more annotations you have, the less value they are of. But there are also circumstances when annotations in a particular period or by particular individuals will give the books even more value. Then how can we evaluate this unstable sense of value interruption that annotations bring to the original copies?</span></p>

I think in this context, the pdf version does resonate with the original print versions of books in that, the authors notes, which are printed out and the readers&rsquo; annotations and notes, which are handwritten, are separated and are valued differently. But still, I don&apos;t think this article answers the question it raised, &ldquo;how or whether documents are somehow different when aggregated and served up by databases rather than collected and fished out of filing cabinets&rdquo; (117), Which is also what I was wondering about throughout reading this week&apos;s articles.</span></p>
