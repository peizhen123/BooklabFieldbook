<p>In this bibliography, I am focusing on two readings, Elyse Graham, &ldquo;The Printing Press as Metaphor&rdquo; and Sarah Werner, &ldquo;Type&rdquo; and &ldquo;Printing&rdquo; from <em>Studying Early Printed Books, 1450-1800 : A Practical Guide. </em>The main question that I wish to ask is, to what extent we are viewing the printing industry a technical field and what effects this phenomenon is creating to humanities scholars? </p>
<p>This article centers around the metaphor of the printing press and discusses &ldquo;our popular uses of historical metaphor to explain them. Why, in particular, do we turn to the rise of the printing press, out of all the options available, as our standard analogy for the rise of the internet?&rdquo;. While it is fascinating to see how &ldquo;the printing press as a symbol of technological change likewise tends to imply that historical change is revolutionary and progressive&rdquo;, I am a bit concerned about the dominant role technology has made in our fields. To equal technological advancements with &ldquo;progress&rdquo; is dangerous as it may lead to viewing technological advancements as the only path to make a better society. At the end of the article, Graham draws to the discipline of humanities, &ldquo;Writing for the New Republic, Adam Kirsch asks why we cannot simply proceed as before with the new tools: &ldquo;Was it necessary for a humanist in the past five hundred years to know how to set type and publish a book? Moreover, is it practical for a humanities curriculum that can already stretch for ten years or more, from freshman year to Ph.D., to be expanded to include programming skills?&rdquo; I am personally very into Digital Humanities, but thinking about Interdisciplinarity as a whole, I am wondering to what extent this means Programming dominance? Can humanities scholars (particularly younger ones) have the right to retain themselves from delving into programming, especially concerning the fact that humanities training is generally slow-paced but technological advancements are extremely fast-paced? Or is it already a trend that they could not and should not resist, or they will risk not finding a job in the printing industry?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this problem comes from a (perhaps not accurate enough) impression that the press industry is mainly about printing as a technology (this is only taking the word &ldquo;printing&rdquo; literally). Reading the section on &ldquo;Printing&rdquo; leaves me with the impression that the technology of how printing works in a historical contexts is one of the main concerns. Of course, Werner also points out that &ldquo;This sort of work&mdash;moving from looking at bibliographic features to deducing press operations&mdash;has opened up many larger possibilities for study&rdquo;. Indeed, the printing industry now is also concerned with design, and literary/economic/political concerns outside of technology. But the impression that printing is mainly about technology gives an overestimated status of digital technologies for the printing press industry, which can, in a sense, be deficient to humanities students.&nbsp;</p>
