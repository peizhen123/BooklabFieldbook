<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">One of the fascinations of reading Octave Uzanne&rsquo;s &ldquo;The End of Books&rdquo; (1894) is to see how accurately this short fiction predicts the future. &ldquo;Printing is&hellip;threatened with death by the various devices for registering sound which have lately been invented, and which little by little will go on to perfection.&rdquo; (223). &ldquo;Libraries will be transformed into phonographotecks, or rather, phonostereoteks&rdquo;; and authors will become &ldquo;tellers&rdquo; with recordings. Considering what is happening today, it is hard to imagine that this fiction came from the late Victorian period. In today&rsquo;s context, videos and audios have largely replaced many reading materials (see how popular Tik Tok is among younger generations). In a course I taught, in which I asked students to read Late Victorian novels, I was not sure how many of them substitute the reading with watching the film versions or even 5-10 mins &ldquo;short synopsis&rdquo; on Youtube. Of course, as a literary scholar, this is unbearable, since for viewing fiction in a literary sense, not reading the original texts will result in missing most of the narration and discourse that are important parts of the fiction. But I am wondering that out of the academic realm, are audio and video forms more efficient than reading as well? I personally love reading texts more because I can start and stop whenever I can and read at my own speed, and there is no need to find an earphone (I often auto transcribe video and audio into texts). I also appreciate the interaction between me and the &nbsp;reading materials (I have to turn pages or at least, scroll) because that keeps me focused. But the question still remains &ndash; do audio and video forms transmit more info than reading materials, or that the more info is actually a distraction that should be avoided?&nbsp;</span></p>

In this article, I am a bit confused about the point of defeat. &ldquo;To grasp the shadowy and fantasmal form of a book,&rdquo; the literary critic Percy Lubbock famously wrote in 1921, &ldquo;to hold it fast, to turn it over and survey it at leisure&mdash;that is the effort of a critic of books, and it is perpetually defeated.&rdquo; Tenen explained that &ldquo;This failure of interpretation stems from the fundamental incompatibilities between the innermost symbolic, discursive realms and the outermost, corporeal, and embodied techniques of comprehension: the first, limited by the expressive possibilities of (p. 321) language, and the second by the cognitive and perceptual mechanics of the human body.&rdquo; Is he arguing that it is impossible to interpret the form of a book? If so, what does &ldquo;outermost, corporeal, and embodied techniques&rdquo; symbolize? Is he arguing that the format of the books which are corporeal can never be compatible with the content of the book, which is symbolic? Then why is the human body involved? Or is he saying that viewing from a human/machine interaction perspective, there is no resolution to suit the human body with the symbolic content of texts?&nbsp;</span></p>

Elements of a plot must, for all their variability, fit within a book&rdquo;. This comes from the frustrations of reading comic books on my paper tablet. Though the tablet does its best to imitate the paper textual and thus made color and strokes of these pictures resemble that of paintings on paper, the narrative flow of a comic book is destroyed because of the inability of illustrating facing pages due to the screen limit. Nevertheless, some storyboards in comic books rely heavily on open pages, with the element of surprise created through flipping over to the next page and have an open page (thus two total pages) to overwhelm the readers. Without open pages, the effect of this technique is nearly totally ruined. The solutions of that can be a combination of print-digital format, as Ortega suggests. I suppose in the future, books that heavily rely on format (like the comic books that I mentioned) will adapt themselves to have a print form and a specially designed digital form.&nbsp;</span></p>
