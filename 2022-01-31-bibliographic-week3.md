## Hannah Alpert-Abrams, “Archaeology of a Book: An Experimental Approach to Reading Rare books in Archival Contexts” (2016)

This work introduces a series of projects related to “the long history of the Advertencias para los confessores de los Naturales, a confessional manual printed at a Franciscan convent and school in Tlatelolco, Mexico around 1601” (introduction). Several sections like acquisition, production, digital futures, collections introduce how these manuscripts are produced, spread across space and time, read by different readers and preserved using today’s digital technology. One important issue that I wish to bring to class concerns the digitalization. I think this project partly answers my long-last question: what can digitization and new media forms do beyond making manuscripts digitally readable and searchable? Cobre developed by Texas A&M University, gives a good example by creating “a comparative "filmstrip" that allows for the side-by-side comparison of multiple copies”, which I think is really helpful in bringing in interactivity for researchers. But what more can we do in terms of contributing to public humanities? 

## Sarah Werner, “Part 1: Overview” and “Part 3: On the Page” from Studying Early Printed Books, 1450-1800 : A Practical Guide (2019)
These two sections generally provide some basic introduction of the process of printing a book, and some basic elements in a book. What I am interested in is the discussion of “ideal copies”. Can we understand “ideal copies” as copies that is the most comprehensive view of a book’s elements in different copies? Or even in the same “edition” (I know this phrase hasn’t existed yet in earlier times) may produce copies that are “different” in a sense that influences our studies today? What are the differences that are being considered? 

## Amaranth Borsuk, “The Book as Object” from *The Book* (2018)
This chapter generally introduces the history of the book as a media type cross times and cultures. It is fascinating to see how the book format can vary so much across time and language systems, but also echo with one another in some sense (I see similar patterns of using folios across eastern and western cultures). I am particularly interested in the sequence of language on earlier books. On page 37, figure 2, particularly c and d, we see the ancient Chinese language is actually written from up to down instead of from left to right/right to left. Some books in Japan or Taiwan still use this kind of format. I am wondering which format is actually more effective and what factors are influencing the perseverance of up-to-down format. Can the Indo-European languages also be written in up-to-down format (like the spines of modern books?) And how would that influence readers (it is extremely hard for me to read the spines of book titles in English as a second language speaker). 

## Linc Kesler, “Indigenous People and the Written Word” from *The Unfinished Book* (2021)
This essay provides an insight on how European political and cultural colonization provides a disruption to the indigenous culture and how the indigenous communities react to this new culture of written books. The thing that attracts my attention is the genre of oral history mentioned in this article. “A key premise in Havelock’s account is that the system of oral narratives is never fully realized and always fully present: it exists, in other words, as an “environment.”” I see (at least in my culture) that there is a general impression of inferiority of oral culture compared to written ones. I am from a minor ethnicity in China, and my ethnic culture is considered “insignificant” and “less civilized” because the written language system didn’t preserve till today. But I see there is an essential difference between the oral history and the written one — that through retelling, oral history is always in a dynamic change. The written history, with its seemingly more advanced and logical structure, prevents this flexibility. Bringing this back to indigenous culture — how should we understand and study oral history of the indigenous culture without judging and interfering with its particular form and its dynamic?
