<p>In this week&rsquo;s bibliography, I would like to bring some of my experiences in reading to related themes discussed in our readings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is the &ldquo;Book as Virtual Reality&rdquo; idea from &ldquo;Book as Idea&rdquo;(<em>THE BOOK AS IDEA</em>). This actually doesn&rsquo;t coordinate with my perception of books, as I often think of books (especially traditional ones) as more stiff in its format and requires less interaction. nevertheless, &ldquo;books are always a negotiation, a performance, an event: even a Dickens novel remains inert until a reader opens it up, engaging its language and imaginative world. Artists&rsquo; books continually remind us of the reader&rsquo;s role in the book by forcing us to reckon with its materiality and, by extension, our own embodiment&rdquo; (147). For example, <em>the Big Book</em> offers a good example of how interactive books can be.&nbsp;My question lies on the interactivity of books in this age of new media, like TV and laptops. To what extent can paper books be advantageous in interactivity compared to these new media formats. I was reminded of an example of &ldquo;Anime books&rdquo; that I was fascinated by in my childhood. It is generally just comic books that can &ldquo;move&rdquo; because you have to flip it very fast to make the figures move continuously. These books are usually very thick, and their storylines are not dense (think about how many pages they need to do a single action), and they require better quality for readers to flip them fluidly. They are printed ones, but I have seen greater efforts to create hand-drawn anime, which requires even more efforts in precision and quantity. Then I am wondering how is this reading experience different from, say, watching an anime? Is it the educational purpose for children to understand how anime works originally? Does the flipping process itself indicate a sense of interactivity that other formats cannot give?</p>
<p>Wigginton&rsquo;s article and Goldsby&rsquo;s article (Goldsby; Wigginton) both talk about books, literatures and bibliographies of marginalized groups. In particular, I am fascinated by the statement &ldquo;Examining these lays bare the signal development that distinguishes mid-twentieth-century African-American authorship from its eighteenth- and nineteenth-century precedents: namely, &nbsp;the turn away from writing as corroboration of black humanity to writing as expressive of black pluralities or personae&rdquo;. Indeed, I see similar trends of book covers while teaching a undergraduate Postcolonial class. the books I am teaching are nineteenth century British popular novels related to imperialism (like <em>The Sign of Four, Heart of Darkness</em>). Since I am using the Broadview edition and the serial book cover usually features a face, it is not hard to see theses faces as particularly representative of black communities and Indian communities. It seems that the ethnicity of these people matters more than their actual faces. Of course, these books are written by white British, so the African and Indian populations depicted in the books are more of symbols. But if we look at, say, the poster of the movie Moonlight, we could experience the deep emotions in the collage of these three faces. So I agree that the book faces already indicate some differences in the publishing of marginalized communities.</p>
<p>Piper et al&rsquo;s article again speaks to the interpretability of errors in digitization(Piper et al.). I always use the scanner app on my cellphone to digitize some print books, and I did realize that the scan and recognize function works better in some books than in others. Mostly, more recent books are better transcribed, and books without special formatting (such as footnotes or side notes) are easier to recognize. But, instead of just finding ways to eliminate errors like computer scientists do, this article digs deeper into these errors and examined how these errors might affect our perception of the printing history. &nbsp;</p>
