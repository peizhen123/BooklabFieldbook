# Lab 1: Well That Was Illuminating!

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an English as a second language student, It is actually extremely hard for me to recognize the texts that I was transcribing. I literally could only understand around 20% of it. And I barely knew what he was writing about. Because of this, it also became really easy to lose track of which line I was transcribing. This experience reminds me of some transcribed manuscripts that I have seen before that were ridiculously inaccurate.  Although I am not native speaker, I've been learning and using English for more than 20 years and I am officially in the English department, but still it is very hard for me to read a relatively clearly written transcript. Then I would assume that in the past, If someone was transcribing some words or even a language that they were not very familiar with, it would greatly influence the accuracy of the transcription. Therefore, this transcribing experience is both an exciting one and a challenging one for me. In those 30 minutes, I was struggling with reading the words while seeing the other people around me doing much faster and better than I was. The dim light provided by the candle is also what was Preventing me from recognizing the words. As it turned out, I felt I could understand much more than before when the electric light came back. 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This transcribing experience made me understand how hard work it is to collect and digitize a collection. I studied the Composition history of J. R. R. Tolkien’s *The Lord of the Rings* before and what I actually read was not the manuscript that Tolkien himself produced,  but the digitized version that Christopher Tolkien, his son, published. In that essay that I wrote, I criticized how there were so few historical versions of a published novel that have been Preserved and even fewer were digitized. Now, with this transcribing experience and the hardships that I experienced, It is not hard to imagine why Christopher Tolkien spent nearly his whole lifetime transcribing and digitizing his father's manuscripts and drafts and why there are so few digitalization of authors’ historical versions of published novels preserved.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly interested in the tagging system in Information science. I study fan fiction, and the most famous fan fiction website, Archives of Our Own (AO3), is famous for its elaborate tagging system. So I took a look at how the tagging system on the internet operates and developed throughout time. Basically, a tag is a keyword or turn assigned to a piece of Information which can describe an item and also allow you to filter out Information (“Tag (Metadata)”). For example, on AO3, you can use these tags to filter the kinds of fan fiction that you like such as relationships, word count, languages, completion status, etc. Searching for the history of the tagging system actually reveals that it came from another system called edge notched card. Edge notched cards were a data processing tool commonly used in the mid 20th century priority to the widespread availability of laptops. By notching the edges of cards with holes punched in them, you can encode arbitrary binary data which can then be filtered and sorted on using a simple metal needle (*Edge-Notched Cards: A Queryable Database...Made of Paper* - YouTube). The needle as a technical element in this edge notched cards system is fascinating for me because it is a physical form that actually materialized the filtering process that we do today in websites. There is a great metaphor implied in this needle element. When we are doing digitalization, we are not only transforming texts from physical to digital format, but also transforming all the actions of writing, filtering and sorting into digital actions like clicking the tagging systems and filtering Information.
