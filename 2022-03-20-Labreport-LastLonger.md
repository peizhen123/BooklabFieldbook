<p><strong>Lab 7: It'll Last Longer</strong></p>

<p>In this experiment, I especially focused on two objects. The first is the Illustrations of the family of Psittacidae, or parrot, by Edward Lear made in the year 1832. The second one is the historie of foure-footed beastes: describing the true and liuely figure of euery beast, with a discourse of their seuerall names, conditions, kindes, evrtues, countries of their breed by Topsell, Edward, which is created in 1607. Both objects share one big similarity – they are both supposed to be documented from “true” and “lively” creatures. Though the amount of imagination involved might be very different in the two objects. </p>

<p>Though I am not an expert in parrots, I can see some efforts in catching the authenticity of these images. Regarding the illustrations of parrot, cataloguing should not be a problem – it can be under the real-life encyclopedia like bibliographies in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. For example, at the bottom of the images, it says something like ¾ Nat Size, which indicates that they are trying to describe how big this parrot looks like in real life. What caught my eyes were the vibrant colors of these pictures of parrot and how vivid the images are even if shown on paper. If we look close enough, we will see even the textures of the parrot’s fur are depicted in detail. These features remind me of some artistic works, instead of works from a encyclopedia like book. They quickly reminded me of photo pictures, though we know they are not. If I were to make this book interactive on a digital platform, I would actually put the photo images of these kinds of parrots besides the images shown on the picture, so that the audience can see how accurate these images are in the 19<sup>th</sup> century to get a better sense of animal science in that period. </p>

<p>However, I can see there are still some barriers when it comes to digitization. In this object’s sense, is the accuracy of the color captured by camera and the loss of the texture of the paper that indicates lithography, the printing technique. Putting the image next to the photo I took from my iPhone 11, I could see that the colors have changed greatly – they become less vibrant and darker. As someone who is also invested in digitization in Art Museums, the color deviation is almost unacceptable, especially regarding the fact that these are images about parrots, which are famous for their colors. From the photo taken, it is also very hard to guess what printing technique is used to create these images, partly because of the unfamiliarity of lithography, and because of the loss of some texture information on paper that cannot be captured by 2D photos. Also, it is really hard to imagine that this object is created in 1832, because colored lithography’s quality didn’t greatly improved until the 1890s, and commercial colored lithography appeared widely in the 1860s. the random lithographic works that I saw on the internet don’t have such great color quality as this object. So if this object were to be digitized, there need to be some explanation of the status of lithography in its period (1830s) and maybe some process documents to explain lithography. Otherwise, this object looks like a myth or magic to me. </p>

<p>The historie of foure-footed beastes, on the other hand, may not be easily categorized. In the 17<sup>th</sup> century when it was created, it can be under the encyclopedia category, but concerning some of the imagined creatures depicted in this book, I would be reluctant to call it a “history of beast” in today’s context. I almost started to question if the author created these “fantastic” images to attract customers as easter eggs, but the detailed explanations under these images suggest that they are taking these creatures seriously. </p>

<p>When it comes to digitization, I think these images are inseparable from the descriptions lying under them. The images themselves are easy to digitize, as they are mostly black and white and don’t involve delicate texture or strokes. But I am concerned about the texts written. Because the poor paper quality, it is easy to see words from the next page, and this may disrupt the OCR process if we were to digitize these texts for further research. At the same time, I am wondering if there is a need to recategorize this book when we are digitizing it. Some of the beasts do exist in real world, but some definitely are not. So if some readers are only checking this book randomly instead of reading it in whole, they might have a misconception of how authentic and trustworthy this book is when it comes to depiction four footed animals in the 17<sup>th</sup> century. Therefore, I think it is possible to have two tables of content page for this book, one in the original format, and the other rearranged with today’s perception. </p>
