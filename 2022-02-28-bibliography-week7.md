<p>This week&rsquo;s theme, &ldquo;Text&rdquo;, asks us questions concerning how we view texts as they are. For this, I would like to focus on two aspects of text, the materiality of texts and the efforts to make texts universally presentable. <br />The old Linotype technology presented in the document is a physical embodiment of the materiality of texts. The &ldquo;hot metal typesetting&rdquo; machine&rsquo;s aim is to produce metal molds for words to be printed in the New York Times. At first sight, texts seem inalterable because they are physically imprinted in metal molds, which are considered to be more stable than woods or other materials. But at the same time, the documentary shows that the molds are reusable &ndash; they can be melted down and reused. In this sense, texts imprinted on them are extremely unstable. <br />Cordell&rsquo;s article on OCR presents another way to view texts as embodiment that can take other forms. &ldquo;My focus on OCR thus far also pressures myths of surrogacy, in large part because OCR-derived text so rarely can stand in for the texts from which it derives&rdquo; (200). The &ldquo;surrogacy&rdquo; metaphor is fascinating here, as though OCR should be transcribing the original texts, they are not intended for human readers but for searching or other CS related research purposes. Then we might need to ask, what exactly is altered to transcribe texts in its original form (like in the newspaper) to an OCR version? The format is changed (we can no longer perceive the original newspaper formatting of these texts); some characters might be misdetected; its intentional readers have also changed. Of course, researchers are trying their best to link the OCR version to its original printed form, like Penn State Library provides links to the original photocopies. But still I wish to ask, what is changed when we switch from reading newspapers day to day to search keywords to find related content in an OCR newspaper platform? <br />In order for the texts to be illustrated in forms other than photocopies and to be searched in a search machine, we need to have some roles to &ldquo;encode&rdquo; them. Zentgraf&rsquo;s article &ldquo;What Every Programmer Absolutely, Positively Needs To Know About Encodings And Character Sets To Work With Text&rdquo; gives us a brief introduction to this coding and encoding process and the &ldquo;unicode&rdquo; history. In fact, the word &ldquo;unicode&rdquo; itself has interesting implications. &ldquo;Finally somebody had enough of the mess and set out to forge a ring to bind them all and create one encoding standard to unify all encoding standards.&rdquo; The indication is that languages from all over the world should abide by the same system of encoding and representation. While this might be easier for Indo-European languages, it is not the case for languages in other systems. Zentgraf&rsquo;s article gives us a hint on how hard it is to represent Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages. Mullaney quoted at the beginning of the introduction, &ldquo;The typewriter was invented to suit the English language, not the English language the typewriter&rdquo; (1). The result is that digitization in the Indo-European languages is far more advanced than other ones. I once tried to study 19th century English and Chinese documents for comparison, and found 19th century English newspapers are generally all-content searchable, and some official Chinese documents in the same period even didn&rsquo;t have an accessible photocopy version. There are many factors influencing this difference, but I am wondering to what extent the CS encoding system designed for English creates barriers for other languages to be digitized and preserved. East Asian languages, with the great population still using them, are experiencing such a crisis, and what about other endangered languages that few are using? Should we let them &ldquo;die out&rdquo; because they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t fit&rdquo; the globalized unified process in digitization?</p>
