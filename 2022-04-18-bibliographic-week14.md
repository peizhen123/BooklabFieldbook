    In this week’s reading, I started off with “Untangling the Tale of Ada
Lovelace”(    <em>Untangling the Tale of Ada Lovelace—Stephen Wolfram Writings</em>) and
    skipped through the mathematical equations while reading it, and then moved
    on to “Do Digital Humanists Need to Understand Algorithms?” (““48. Do
    Digital Humanists Need to Understand Algorithms?”). As soon as I read the
    first several paragraphs of the latter work, I jumped back to Ada Lovelace
    and reread the equations out of the concern that as a Digital Humanist, I
    should be able to follow the equations and understand algorithms behind.
    After several google search on mathematic terms, I gradually got to know
    more (though definitely not full) of some fundamental thoughts behind the
    thinking machine. So my answer is yes, Digital Humanists need to understand
    basic algorithms as to understand how computational methods produce their
    results, otherwise they are not going to interpret the results in any
    sense. But I do understand that relying too much or solely on Algorithms
    might be a problem. To be frank, I don’t think we can ever fully understand
    how algorithms work. “Seen in these terms, the algorithm is a process whose
    operations are fundamentally opaque; we can poke or prod to see if it
    matches our hopes, but we can never truly <em>know</em> it.” At the same
    time, we may have assumptions of the algorithms that we use that we didn’t
    realize and may not be true. “in this case, the geometries and coordinate
    systems we use to chart plots are themselves emblazoned with a particular
    model. Such line charts assume that time is linear and infinite.” Besides
    the intrinsic values of Fourier transform that should make the plot charts
    in polar coordinates, we also need to acknowledge that the composition
    history of a plot itself is not linear. While in this example, it becomes
    clear that the underlying assumption is the linear model, how should we
    deal with other assumptions. Are they explicit and how should we deal with
    them? Do we simply acknowledge the assumptions and not doing anything about
    it (like in a “discussion” section of an article)? Will these assumptions
    fully overthrow some of the results we have?

    The Abstraction, Singularity, Textuality chapter, on the other hand, speaks
    more broadly of some problems lying in distant reading (BODE). Frankly
    speaking, reading this piece makes me uneasy, not because the statements
    are problematic – but exactly because many statements do point out some
    problems in Distant Reading, which many Digital Humanists from the literary
    side use. My major concern for this chapter is, to what extent these
    problems are solvable, or Bode is simply implying that distant reading is
    intrinsically problematic and should not be used alongside with close
    reading? Some of the problems that she points out definitely echoes with my
    understanding. The lack of interpretable results, or “data, not
    interpretation”, is what distant reading is lacking, and there are ways to
    accommodate for that if literary scholars also take efforts to know
    algorithms and interpret the results. For example, if Jockers can
    accurately predict author gender of a given text, how is this done? Are
    there common features that are considered “feminine style of writing”?
    Nevertheless, to say that “in Moretti’s and Jockers’s approach, which
    claims to represent everything— directly, comprehensively, and objectively—
    while exploring only a limited part of any given literary system”, that if
    claimed distant reading then it should cover EVERYTHING is also asking for
    too much. I don’t think distant reading can and plans to cover everything –
    the “distance” here means that it covers much more than what close reading
    can do to avoid limited scope and confirmation biases. I see there is a
    trend among traditional literary scholars to resist distant reading as it
    is going to disrupt literary analysis. I am not sure where this is coming
    from. Are they fearing that this would replace close reading (which I
    assume would not)? Or are them simply fearing that they will be put behind
    by not joining this digital trend with the lack of technical knowledge and
    training?
