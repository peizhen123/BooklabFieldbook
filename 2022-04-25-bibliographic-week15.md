<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-family:Times;">It was 1 am in the morning. I stopped working on a project about Cyberpunk fiction, and decided I could start the readings for this week since one of them is lengthy. I then opened Jon Bois, <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football/">&ldquo;What Football Will Look Like in the Future&rdquo;</a>.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Times;">(Bois)</span><span style="font-family:Times;">&nbsp;The moment the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; news interface became big black words coming at me, and then turning into a calendar, I thought I was in a Cyberpunk world, literally. I thought maybe some parts of the world went wrong and I became the &ldquo;Neo&rdquo; in the matrix.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-family:Times;">That was my first encounter with this &hellip; reading. I could not define it and cannot decide what genre it is. Is this a fiction? If it is, does it have a clear plot or a character list? Of course, we see characters like &ldquo;Nine&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nancy&rdquo;, but I think most of the typed words are anonymous. And it doesn&rsquo;t aways come with words. Sometimes also with interactive pictures and videos. Since we were talking about genre classification last time and this is relevant, how could we set a boundary (if we should) for literary works and genres in today&rsquo;s context? I ask this question in the perspective of preservation &ndash; that is, if we were to preserve these materials, the first step would be to classify which genre it belongs to for indexing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-family:Times;">Going off with this point, I think another reading of this week, &ldquo;Agrippa&rdquo; or the Book of the Dead, also speaks to the problem of classification and indexing&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Times;">(<em>The Agrippa Files</em>)</span><span style="font-family:Times;">. Looking at the home page of this website, I found it hard to understand what kind of project it is. What kind of &ldquo;Book&rdquo; is this? What does it have to do with &ldquo;Cracking the Agrippa Code&rdquo; contest? How do we imagine the format of this book? Is it going to be a physical copy or is it reliant on the internet to present? How is it relevant to the fading ink simulation? This website seems to me a collage of different elements that are not intrinsically relevant to each other, but magically bound together with the theme &ldquo;Agrippa&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-family:Times;">Another thing I am interested is the &ldquo;interactivity&rdquo; of the interface, which is our main topic today. For &ldquo;inter-&rdquo;, it has a sense of a reciprocal relationship. Unlike the &ldquo;format&rdquo; of the book that we have discussed in the past, I am interested in how these new formats interact with readers. While I was reading &ldquo;What Football will look like in the future&rdquo;, I found that I was paying more attention to the words if the process of typing out is shown through videos. I would spontaneously track the typing of sentences and process what they mean while it is typing. The AI dungeon game, on the other hand, forces me to pay attention to the words it narrates so that I can use my own words to continue the story. And as I was comparing m story with some players on YouTube, I found that the more specific you write, the better quality the AI will create (I don&apos;t have statistics to support that). then this feature speaks another part of interactivity. The more you are engaged, the better the quality of the texts is. Then the question is, to what extent do you think reader&rsquo;s response can and should impact the original texts and format? Are we stepping off too much and giving readers too much power to twist the texts if we offer too much free form interactions?&nbsp;</span></p>
