<p>I think these zine pamphlets are not the only kind of media type that resists the general trend of digitization. In fact, in fanfiction communities in China, I also see how some special kinds of fanfiction and fan art are resistant to being digitized, preserved and publicly available. This particularly applies to fanfictions and fan works with erotic contents and sensitive topics. in fact, I would regard this kind of media type as “escapist”, in its essence to escape from censorship. </p>

<p>Currently, there are no websites where you can publish fanfiction and fan works without censorships, which means that fan works with adult contents have literally no space to be shared with public. AO3, which used to be the shelter for these works in China, was banned because of a fan incident happened in 2020. Textual information can so easily be examined with automatic censorship systems. Popular websites for fanfiction in China, such as Lofter and Weibo, will censor all textual content automatically before it gets published, and texts with sensitive words will not be available to the public. Then how can fanfiction authors publish fanfiction with adult and sensitive content online? They will transform texts to images to escape censorship. This technique used to work, but current censorship programs have developed OCR techniques to censor texts in images as well. So fanfiction writers go further and used various techniques to disrupt OCRs. This could include, turning the background to blue or black, making the images upside down, turning into mirror images, adding non-sensitive texts at the beginning of images, adding watermarks, etc. But this is still not the final success for Fanfiction writers on these platforms – even if writers successfully published the works online, they still risks the blogs being deleted because there will be random checks for published works. That is why fanfiction writers, while writing sensitive works, would add notes saying “please don’t give kudos to this work because this will put it in higher risks of recensoring. Just open and save the images on your end and scroll away”. After a few days, fanfiction authors will even delete works with adult content themselves, because they fear that their accounts will be deactivated if the censorship system finds that too many works on this account get deleted because of sensitive content. </p>

<p>This was a strange phenomenon for me at first, because for most of the times, I thought fan communities would do their best to preserve what they have produced to fans as long as possible. But after searching for the reasons behind, I think this kind of escapism itself is worth discussion. Fan fiction is a genre of resistance – it resists author’s full authority and gives readers chances to develop their own characters and plots. But in our case here, fanfiction is not only resisting authors (in copyright, etc.), but also in administrative agencies that constrain freedom to write. I will not simply draw a conclusion like “censorship should be abandoned”. Without a appliable rating system, there is still a long way to go. What I am more curious about is how will this kind of escapist media change in the future where OCR becomes more advance and can even target these distorted images? Will there be a secret platform built for fan fiction writers (I have seen prototypes)? Will this “hide and seek” game stop at one point or will it always be continuous and everchanging? </p>
